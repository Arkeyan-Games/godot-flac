# NOTICE: [gd-flac](https://github.com/DeleteSystem32/gd-flac) now has (much better!) support for stable 4.x builds, making this module pretty much useless.

# godot-flac
Mostly functional module to add FLAC support to stable Godot 4.x builds.
Based on the official MP3 module and [gd-flac](https://github.com/DeleteSystem32/gd-flac), made because the 4.x branch of the latter does not work with Godot's stable 4.x builds.

Looping and anything relating to BPM/beats/measures are untested and there is no guarantee it will work. At least basic looping should work, in theory.
